- Slides 5-6 should have video placeholders that can be replaced with actual demo videos
- Use animations sparingly, only for key transitions
- Ensure all text is large enough to read in presentation mode
- Slide 1 should have maximum visual impact as the opening
- Slide 2 should establish team credibility with professional layout
