## [0:30-1:45] Problem Statement (1 minute 15 seconds)

ONE Championship is a world-class martial arts organization with high popularity in Japan. The athletes have overwhelming skills, and the core value is **"RESPECT" for the fighters**.

On the other hand, in Japan, organizations like RIZIN and BREAKINGDOWN have succeeded with a unique approach. Although the athlete level does not match ONE, they have gained explosive popularity on social media by **turning fighter stories and rivalries into entertainment**. Fans emotionally connect with the narratives and become deeply involved.

**The challenge is clear.** While preserving ONE's value of **"RESPECT"**, we need to create a new entertainment experience where fans actively participate and co-create stories together with athletes.

## [1:45-2:30] Solution & Market Analysis (45 seconds)

We analyzed the relationship between martial arts and fans by dividing it into **five phases**, and explored what Web3 can do.

In this hackathon, we present **two product demos** and **one concept**.

**Phase 2: Pre-Match**  
Community voting visualizes high-demand matchmaking and makes ONE's event planning data-driven.

**Phase 3: Post-Match Decision**  
A prediction market with an improved AMM. Zero fees and turns crowd psychology into content.

**Phase 4: During Match**  
Sponsor advertisement NFTs display ads on fighter outfits. This creates a new monetization model.

## [2:30-3:00] Demo 1: Community Voting (30 seconds)

[While showing the video]

Fans vote for the matches they want to see, and the demand is visualized in real-time. ONE can plan events based on what the audience truly wants.

---

## [3:00-3:30] Demo 2: Sponsor NFT (30 seconds)

[While showing the video]

Sponsor companies purchase NFTs to display advertisements on fighter outfits. This is NFT-ization of advertising rights.

Also, the NFT metadata is hosted on **Walrus** for permanent storage.

## [3:30-4:15] Prediction Market Concept (45 seconds)

[Brief explanation]

Through prediction markets, we visualize crowd psychology about match results and turn it into stories. This is still in the idea stage.

The core idea is **LSMR AMM optimized for martial arts**.

Once you bet, you cannot change it later. This has two benefits.

**First**, the UX is simpler than orderbook-type prediction markets, so users can focus on watching the match.

**Second**, until the market closes, deposits can be used for liquid staking or lending. This solves the opportunity cost problem, which is a structural weakness of prediction markets.

And by using the yield from this as protocol fees, we can make **bet fees zero**.

## [4:15-4:50] Partnership & Roadmap (35 seconds)

**Partnership:**

We have a partnership with Japan's fastest-growing martial arts organization. We also partner with China's first K-1 champion.

**Roadmap:**

**Phase 1:** This hackathon proves the core technology

**Phase 2:** Walrus hackathon strengthens story preservation features

**Phase 3:** Fundraising, then full market launch

## [4:50-5:00] Ending (10 seconds)

DOHYO Layer preserves ONE's **"RESPECT"** while enabling fans and athletes to co-create stories together — **a next-generation entertainment experience**.

Thank you very much.
